# iterable is True, and False if all elements are False. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that
# loops through the global list blockedUrls_list, and checks if each word is in the input url. If any word is found in
# url, any returns True, and the function blockedUrls_list returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

## This code defines a function getURL that takes two arguments: link and time_taken. The purpose of this function is
# to extract the webserver and port number from a given URL.
##The function first splits the URL into two parts: the scheme (e.g. "http" or "https") and the rest of the URL. It does
# this by splitting on "://////" and taking the second part of the resulting list. For example, if url is
# "https://www.example.com/foo/bar", the resulting temp list will be ['www.example.com', 'foo', 'bar'].
##Next, the function checks if the port is specified in the webserver string. If it is, the function
# extracts the port number and converts it to an integer. If the port is not specified, the function sets the default
# port number to 443 if the type argument is "https", or 80 if it is "http".
##Finally, the function returns a list containing the webserver and port values. The calling function can then use
# these values to establish a connection to the appropriate web server.
def getURL(link, time_taken):
    # Remove the scheme (http or https) and split the rest of the URL by /.

## This code defines a function data_received that is called every time data is received from a client in a server
# application.
## The function receives the connection object and the client's address as arguments, reads the data from the connection,
# and processes it according to the protocol of the client request.
##If the URL requested by the client is blocked, the function returns without processing the request. If the requested
# web server is in the cache of previous responses, the function returns that response to the client without connecting
# to the web server.
##If the requested web server is not cached, the function establishes a connection to the web server, sends the
# request received from the client, and receives the response from the server. If the request is an HTTP request,
# the response is stored in the cache for future requests.
##If the request is an HTTPS request, the function sends a response to the client indicating that the connection
# is established, sets up a list of connections for the select function, and loops until the connection is closed.
##If an error occurs during the processing of the request, an error message is printed.
# The connection is closed and the count of active connections is decremented.
